Interpretor for working with file system.
You need to create a folder "BackupFolder" and a file "settings.txt" in the root folder of the project for correct interpretor work. 
You can do such operations with this interpretor as : delete file, find files by mask, find files with the same names but in different directories, get the contents of the folder, add and get from backup files, copy the contents of one file to another file, use constructions if and while for some simple operations.
